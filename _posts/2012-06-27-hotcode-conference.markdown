This year we held first edition of [Hotcode][hotcode] conference in beautiful place in [Kyiv Ukraine][venue].

Our vision was to provide developers with the very latest in practical
expertise by letting them learn from the leaders in the technology.

We decided to expand from up to 12 different specialist tracks, each
including a series of relevant talks and practical workshops on JS,
Ruby, Python, Java, .NET, iOS, Android, PHP, QA, DB and Functional
programming.

The idea of the conference has gathered 12+ community leaders in
Ukraine. Each of us runs our own local conferences and meet-ups. But
being inspired by NDC and TopConf, weâ€™d like to establish an
international conferencing environment in Kyiv and bring world scale
experience to the Eastern Europe.

Personaly I was responsiable for [#DB][hotcode:db] and that was my first experience in organizing such kind of event. Though I use to be an active speaker at local python meetups and conferences like PyconUA, I have never had a chance to be in program committee. Experience I have gain was truly amazing, but in general it is all about communication and commitment.

I will write later on about #DB stage talks and videos and for how look how it was
